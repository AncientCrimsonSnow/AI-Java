# GT1_AI-To-solve-Roundbased-board-Game
This repository contains the practical part of the Game Technologies 1 (GT1) course

## Project Overview
This repository implements an AI for a turn-based board game developed in Java. The AI applies strategic decision-making algorithms to compete effectively in the game.

## Features
- **Board Management:** The game board is managed using a bit-based storage system for efficiency.
- **Alpha-Beta Search:** Implements a recursive alpha-beta pruning algorithm for optimal move calculation.
- **Client Management:** A modular client system for interfacing with the game server.
- **Mutation-Based Learning:** Utilizes an evolutionary algorithm for self-improvement.
